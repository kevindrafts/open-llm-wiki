PRESS IS OPENPL. A

## Welcome to the Printing Press.Print the best agent-designed CLI of all time. From anything, or install and use the ones the community has made so far.

From an API spec, from a website with no public API, from a beloved community fan project - one command prints a token-efficient Go CLI, a Claude Code skill, an OpenClaw skill, and an MCP server. Peter Steinberger showed the way with discrawl and gogcli: a local SQLite mirror beats a remote API call, compound commands beat ten round trips, and an agent-native CLI beats raw HTTP. The press bakes that playbook into every binary it prints. Muscle memory for agents.

---

## Every API has a secret identity.

Discord isn't just a chat app - it's a searchable knowledge base. Linear isn't just an issue tracker - it's a team behavior observatory. The press finds that secret and builds the CLI around it.

### When does OKC play next, and what's the cheapest fly-in / next-morning-out?

```
$ /pp-espn nba okc round 2 game 1 + /pp-flightgoat sea-okc, fly-in same day
```

The setup

OKC just won Game 4 vs Phoenix, 131-122. Round 2 Game 1 is TBD on date and opponent. Best estimate for the next OKC home game: Sat May 9 or Sun May 10.

| Date | Out (for ~7pm CT) | RT total |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fri May 8 → Sat May 9 | WN 3936/735 6:30am → 4:40pm CT | $437 |
| Sat May 9 → Sun May 10 | F9 1176/1928 6:52pm → arrives too late | skip |
| Sun May 10 → Mon May 11 | WN 3936/3537 6:15am → 3:05pm CT | $437 |

Pick: Wait 24-48h for ESPN to publish Round 2 Game 1, then book Southwest 1-stop for $437 RT (Wanna Get Away+ for refundable flexibility). Skip Frontier May 9 outbound; lands after tip.

### Find me the best chocolate cake.

```
$ /pp-recipe-goat find chocolate cake --rank trust --servings 8
```

Servings8

1. 1\. Sift 2 cups all-purpose flour, 3/4 cup cocoa, and a pinch of salt together.
2. 2\. Beat 2 cups sugar with 1/2 cup neutral oil; add 2 large eggs one at a time.
3. 3\. Bake at 350F for 30 min timer

### Every blocked issue whose blocker has been stuck for a week.

```
$ /pp-linear sql 'blocked issues whose blocker hasn't moved in 7 days'
```

```
linear-pp-cli sql --compact <<SQL
SELECT i.identifier, i.title, age(now(), b.updated_at) AS stuck
FROM issues i JOIN issue_relations r ON r.issue_id = i.id
JOIN issues b ON b.id = r.related_issue_id
WHERE r.type = 'blocked_by' AND b.state = 'in_progress'
AND b.updated_at < now() - interval '7 days';
SQL
```
- ENG-412 Crash on cold-start · blocked 11d
- ENG-388 Reconnect dropped sockets · blocked 9d
- ENG-301 Backfill missing rows · blocked 8d

50ms against the local SQLite mirror. Compound queries the Linear API can’t answer.

### Find a verified email for a person you've never met.

```
$ /pp-contact-goat 'Jane Doe' company:Acme --use deepline
```

1. 1 Look up on LinkedIn
2. 2 Cross-check Happenstance for warm intros
3. 3 Pay Deepline for the verified email

Magic-moment recording in flight. The CLI ships today; the type-specimen page lands when the screen recording does.
